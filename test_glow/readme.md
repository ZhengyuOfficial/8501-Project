# Glow
Glow is a generative model, belonging to the class of normalising flows, which generates complex, high-dimensional data by learning an invertible mapping between the data distribution and a simpler underlying distribution, usually a Gaussian distribution. We try to improve RealNVP to GLOW to increase the accuracy of the model.
