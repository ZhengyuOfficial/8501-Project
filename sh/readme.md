# Bash scripts
We use Bash scripts to prepare and launch a model training task in a specific environment and hardware configuration. The script first specifies resource allocation and job metadata via specific tags, and then defines a number of helper functions to simplify message logging and error handling. Next, the script loaded and unloaded the necessary software modules, switched to the specified directory, and set up the web proxy. After that, the script updated and reloaded the user's environment profile, switched to the model's directory, activated the conda environment, and finally executed the model training command.
