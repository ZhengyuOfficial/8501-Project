#.pth file
The .pth file is usually the model weights file saved at the end of the training process. When training a neural network, the model weights are updated over time to minimise the loss function on the training data.
Since the original file is too large, a Google drive link is provided here to download it.

Evaluation:
You can use this weights file to evaluate the performance of the model on both the validation dataset and the test dataset.
Continue Training:

If you want to continue training the model on the existing base, you can start with this weights file.
Migration Learning:

You can use this weights file as a pre-trained model for other tasks. For example, if your model was trained on a large dataset, you can use its weights as initial weights for your own task.
Deployment:

If your model has been trained, you can use this weights file to deploy the model to a production environment, such as a web service or a mobile application.
Share or publish:

If you want to share your work or publicly distribute your model, you can make this weights file available for others to use.
This .pth file is the PyTorch framework's model saving format, and it can be easily loaded using PyTorch's torch.load() function.
